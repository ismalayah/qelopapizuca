The show is a Japanese manga series that was written and illustrated by well-known author, Yumi Tamura. Anime fans thoroughly enjoyed the show, as it provided an interesting science-fiction storyline that hadn’t been seen before. However, its future isn’t looking bright after a shocking piece of news.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 data-injectable=false>What is 7 Seeds about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Netflix series</a> let viewers watch as astronomers predicted that at some point in the near future, Earth was going to be struck by a meteorite. This caused the current world leaders to come together and develop a plan that would ensure each country would try to keep a certain amount of young and healthy people safe and secure. They did this by using cryogenics that would allow these people to survive when the meteorite officially struck the Earth.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>There was also going to be a computer that would determine if, and when, it would be safe to awaken those selected so that they may start to build back the Earth and populate it again. In Japan, the government decided to create five different groups that each contained seven people, as well as one adult who had been trained and knew about how to survive while in the wilderness.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>However, none of the 35 people were told what they were getting into and what they were doing before they were put in the cryogenic chamber to help save the Earth. The five groups of people were spread out amongst different parts of Japan. When they woke up many years later, after the meteorite had officially hit and destroyed the Earth, they were in complete shock.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>At this point, they learned of their mission when they realized the world was no longer populated. They found out that they would have to all work together in order to survive and try to recreate the world that they knew before they stepped into that cryogenic chamber many years ago.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>With such an interesting plot, anime fans are now left wondering if they will get to enjoy the show for a third season. Here is what we know.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Will there be a third season of 7 Seeds?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7-se-1.jpeg><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, Netflix has officially announced that the show will not be coming back and will not get a third-season renewal on their platform. Netflix has not given an official reason as to why they have decided to cancel the show.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Although it had average ratings, this is not necessarily the answer as to why the cancellation occurred. At this point, fans are hopeful that Netflix will at least release a statement to explain the cancellation to provide some closure.</p><h2 id=h-how-are-fans-reacting-to-the-show-being-canceled data-injectable=false><strong>How are fans reacting to the show being canceled?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-32.png><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Fans of the show are not too pleased with the show being canceled. One user on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> said, “I too was in a depressive slump after finishing the anime. I keep pushing it in any thread or forum hoping that if it gets enough traction they will rescind the cancellation .. I was almost ready to start a petition.”</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditor</a> took to the platform to say, “I just finished it and loved it it’s a damn shame they cancel all the good shows and they give crappy shows like is it cake 10 f****** seasons it’s no wonder Netflix is going down the toilet.”</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>These two users were not the only ones frustrated, as another took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> to say, “Just watched the last episode this morning. I’m definitely invested and would love to see this story continue. I made sure to do a double thumbs if that helps! Lol.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Is there any hope?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MV5BMTk3NjZiMTktODYxMy00ZjZjLTg5YzEtOTA5ODgzYTNlOTA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3MDMxNzU@._V1_.jpg><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>There still might be some hope for fans that the show could continue. As we have seen a few times in the past, if a petition or enough online traction starts to form, shows have been brought back. The most recent example is Brooklyn Nine-Nine.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>The show was originally shown on Fox, but after being canceled, fans were outraged. NBC quickly picked the show up, and it has continued ever since. Another famous example is Family Guy. Believe it or not, the show was also almost canceled in the early days. However, after DVD sales skyrocketed, the show was returned and has gone onto historic levels.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Fans might be upset for now, however, there is still hope that the show might be brought back. Viewers just need to continue to make their voices heard. Unfortunately, after two years of silence, it’s looking unlikely that the 7 Seeds story will continue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6cpq6klGKEbr%2FEnpusZaKawba%2BzWadqKpdqLKiv86nZGxln6d6qr%2BMoqtmm5GjsKa4xJ1m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcould-7-seeds-return-for-season-3-or-is-it-canceled.html&text=Could%207%20Seeds%20return%20for%20season%203%20or%20is%20it%20canceled%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcould-7-seeds-return-for-season-3-or-is-it-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcould-7-seeds-return-for-season-3-or-is-it-canceled.html&title=Could%207%20Seeds%20return%20for%20season%203%20or%20is%20it%20canceled%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcould-7-seeds-return-for-season-3-or-is-it-canceled.html&title=Could%207%20Seeds%20return%20for%20season%203%20or%20is%20it%20canceled%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcould-7-seeds-return-for-season-3-or-is-it-canceled.html&title=Could%207%20Seeds%20return%20for%20season%203%20or%20is%20it%20canceled%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcould-7-seeds-return-for-season-3-or-is-it-canceled.html&description=Could%207%20Seeds%20return%20for%20season%203%20or%20is%20it%20canceled%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kyree-myers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyree Myers- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./famke-janssens-plastic-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Famke Janssens Plastic Surgery Make Her Look A Lot Younger Than 58">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
