"I remember my first time. I was five and a half years old, and she was six. This was in 1928 or 1929. It happened at about the worst time in my life. We had been thrown out of our house . . ."</p><p>The house was in Ehrenfeld, known as Scooptown, and it was a company house owned by the Pennsylvania Coal and Coke Company. When the miners went out on strike, they were evicted from their homes, and the Buchinsky family went to live in the basement of a house occupied by another miner and his eight children. "This would have been the summer before I started school," Bronson says. "I remember my father had shaved us all bald to avoid lice. Times were poor. I wore hand-me-downs. And because the kids just older than me in the family were girls, sometimes I had to wear my sisters' hand-me-downs. I remember going to school in a dress. And my socks, when I got home sometimes I'd have to take them off and give them to my brother to wear into the mines.</p><p>"But, anyway, this was a Fourth of July picnic, and there was this girl, six years old. I gave her some strawberry pop. I gave her the pop because I didn't want it; I had taken up chewing tobacco and I liked that better. I didn't start smoking until I was nine. But I gave her the pop, and then we . . . hell, I never lost my virginity. I never had any virginity."</p><p>He remembers Ehrenfeld well, and has written a screenplay with his wife about life in the mining towns. He worked in the mines from 1939 to 1943, and getting drafted, he says, was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him: "I was well fed, I was well dressed for the first time in my life, and I was able to improve my English. In Ehrenfeld, we were all jammed together. All the fathers were foreign-born. Welsh, Irish, Polish, Sicilian. I was Lithuanian and Russian. We were so jammed together we picked up each other's accents. And we spoke some broken English. When I got into the service, people used to think I was from a foreign country."</p><p>Five boys in his family were drafted into the Army. An older brother, the one who took him into the mines for the first time, was part of the European invasion. "He was a Ranger, and he won a medal," Bronson said. "He was under fire constantly. And he said he'd rather do that than go into the mines again."</p><p>Bronson would not talk about his hometown screenplay, called $1.98, except to say it was fundamentally a love story with a mining town as the environment, but the next afternoon he met with two VISTA workers to discuss possible locations in Appalachia for the film. The towns he had scouted, he told them, looked too good. There were streets, there were lawns where things grew . . .</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqmibmJa%2FrbHSZpmrp56ovK95yK2qZqKlqMFuwMeaq2ahXZm8r8CMpaCknV2pvG7AwKWiZq6Vp8ZuudScnw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcharles-bronson-its-just-that-i-dont-like-to-talk-very-much.html&text=Charles%20Bronson%3a%20%26quot%3bIt%27s%20just%20that%20I%20don%27t%20like%20to%20talk%20very%20much.%26quot%3b%20%7c%20Interviews&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharles-bronson-its-just-that-i-dont-like-to-talk-very-much.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharles-bronson-its-just-that-i-dont-like-to-talk-very-much.html&title=Charles%20Bronson%3a%20%26quot%3bIt%27s%20just%20that%20I%20don%27t%20like%20to%20talk%20very%20much.%26quot%3b%20%7c%20Interviews" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcharles-bronson-its-just-that-i-dont-like-to-talk-very-much.html&title=Charles%20Bronson%3a%20%26quot%3bIt%27s%20just%20that%20I%20don%27t%20like%20to%20talk%20very%20much.%26quot%3b%20%7c%20Interviews" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcharles-bronson-its-just-that-i-dont-like-to-talk-very-much.html&title=Charles%20Bronson%3a%20%26quot%3bIt%27s%20just%20that%20I%20don%27t%20like%20to%20talk%20very%20much.%26quot%3b%20%7c%20Interviews" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharles-bronson-its-just-that-i-dont-like-to-talk-very-much.html&description=Charles%20Bronson%3a%20%26quot%3bIt%27s%20just%20that%20I%20don%27t%20like%20to%20talk%20very%20much.%26quot%3b%20%7c%20Interviews" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./watch-arrowverse-netflix-chronological-order.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How To Watch The Arrowverse On Netflix In Chronological Order">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-quarry-movie-review-2020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Quarry movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2020)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
