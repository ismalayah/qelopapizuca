She may be best known as the better half of celebrated comedian and actor Kevin James; but in her own right, she is a model and actress of Filipino descent. She came to prominence for her role in the 2011 movie Zookeeper, after having starred in Paul Blart: Mall Cop and subsequently its sequel of 2015.</p><p>Since her marriage to Kevin James, he has touted the Filipino-American as a huge inspiration to him and never fails to appreciate her through any medium possible. Read on for details about her background and how she came to be married to the star actor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steffiana-de-la-cruz-%e2%80%93-biography-age></span><strong>Steffiana De La Cruz – Biography & Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christened Stephanie Anna Marie Zantua at birth on the 28th of August 1974, in New York City, Steffiana de la Cruz was born to parents of Filipino descent who had earlier immigrated to the United States. Details about the kind of upbringing she had as well as where had her early education are not available at the moment.</p><p>Steffiana’s interest in modelling began from her childhood days when it was reported that she had a flair for acting and modelling at home. She made the first attempt at pursuing her passion by joining a modelling industry where she spent several years trying her hands at anything that came her way until she landed a minor role in one of late Chris Penn’s Movies. This opened her up to her acting career as she picked up different roles on different stages after that.</p><p>Steffiana de la Cruz appeared on different seasons of The King of Queens which was a CBS series that had a huge amount of views at that time. She played different roles through the series with her final role coming in season 9 as Sienna on ‘Trade Affair’. The budding actress landed a role in 2009 when she appeared as a shopper with kids in Paul Blart: Mall Cop and in 2011, she appeared in Zookeeper which made her a household name.</p><p>The model is not known to have subscribed to any social network over the years and this keeps her away from the sight of the public though it must be said that getting married to a popular actor like Kevin James has ensured that every move she makes is of public record.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-children-life-as-kevin-james-wife></span> <strong>Family: Children, </strong><strong>Life As Kevin James’ Wife<br></strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The astonishing model and actress was in a relationship with late actor Chris Penn from 1993 to 1999, and they lived together. This afforded her the privilege to appear in small roles in some of his films. There was no recorded marriage between the duo or a child out of wedlock.</p><p>After the two broke up, Steffiana De La Cruz stayed single for a while until 2001 when a mutual friend of theirs who was Kevin James’ decorator arranged a blind date between the two. They seemed to get along easily as Steffiana and Kevin James moved in together barely three months after they met. Two years later, an engagement was announced in 2003 to be followed by a wedding on the 19th of June. The ceremony was held at St. Edward Catholic Church in Dana Point, California with a reception at the Montage Resort in Laguna Beach which had over a hundred guests in attendance.</p><p>Since Steffiana’s celebrity marriage to the popular American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and film producer, the actress has had four children starting with Sienna-Marie James who was born in September 2005. Next came Shea Joelle who was born in June 2007 and then a son, Kannon Valentine James, born in 2011. The final arrival into the family came in 2015, a pretty daughter named Sistine Sabella James.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steffiana-de-la-cruz-net-worth></span><strong>Steffiana De La Cruz: Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like most other successful actresses, the Filipino-American actress has managed to gather a tidy sum to her name. From all of her endeavours as an actress and model, Steffiana de la Cruz is worth an estimated $5 million. She paid attention to her family without losing grip of her acting career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-weight></span><strong>Height And Weight</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Steffiana de la Cruz has stunned the world of modelling with her good looks and elegant beauty and she is certainly not lacking in height. She has equally sustained a remarkable weight, even after four children. She stands at a height of 5 feet 8 inches while weighing a commensurate 55kg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKukmrOntcCnmGaclWK5onnCq6yzZZuaw6q6jKOYpp2jYsSqssRmmaKnl6eusbTYZq6io5lisKm1y52pnqZdlrSmew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsteffiana-de-la-cruz-kevin-james-wife-biography-wiki-children-age.html&text=Steffiana%20De%20La%20Cruz%2c%20Kevin%20James%20Wife%20%20Biography%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Children%2c%20Age&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteffiana-de-la-cruz-kevin-james-wife-biography-wiki-children-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteffiana-de-la-cruz-kevin-james-wife-biography-wiki-children-age.html&title=Steffiana%20De%20La%20Cruz%2c%20Kevin%20James%20Wife%20%20Biography%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Children%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsteffiana-de-la-cruz-kevin-james-wife-biography-wiki-children-age.html&title=Steffiana%20De%20La%20Cruz%2c%20Kevin%20James%20Wife%20%20Biography%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Children%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsteffiana-de-la-cruz-kevin-james-wife-biography-wiki-children-age.html&title=Steffiana%20De%20La%20Cruz%2c%20Kevin%20James%20Wife%20%20Biography%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Children%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteffiana-de-la-cruz-kevin-james-wife-biography-wiki-children-age.html&description=Steffiana%20De%20La%20Cruz%2c%20Kevin%20James%20Wife%20%20Biography%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Children%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./usa-today-deed-holder-5-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1247304.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="USA Today Deed holder 5 letters Crossword Clue Answers">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-dwayne-johnson-ethnicity-details-here.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Dwayne Johnson ethnicity? details here">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
