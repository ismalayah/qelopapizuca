While her time as a wrestler in the WWE did not last as long as most other athletes, she still left her mark. Popularly known by her wrestling ring name Super Stacy, Stacy Keibler in addition to being a wrestler is an actress, model, and dancer. She has appeared in TV shows such as Dancing With The Stars and What About Brian. Although she left the WWE in July 2006, her name is still one uttered frequently thanks to the titless she won during her time including the title of WWE Babe of The Year in 2004.</p><p>Unknown to many, her full name is Stacy Ann-Marie Keibler. Super Stacy’s other aliases include Miss Hancock and Skye. She was born on the 14th of October, 1979 in Rosedale, Maryland, United States of America. Her mother’s name is Patricia Keibler while her father’s name is Gary Keibler. The paragraphs below explores the life and career of Stacey Keibler and what she has been up to in recent years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-stacy-keibler></span><strong>What Happened to Stacy Keibler?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>This multifaceted woman has worked many jobs and excelled in different fields. She worked with Stuff magazine from 2005 to 2006 where she was the fitness editor and also had her own column titled Getting Fit With Stacy Keibler. She also competed in the second season of the show Dancing with the Stars where she emerged the third position, although two of the judges believed that she should have been placed second. She is also an accomplished actress as she played the role of Brian’s neighbor and love interest in the ABC series, What About Brian. Keibler also played the character Karen in another ABC series called Samurai Girl. Her wrestling career lasted from 1999 to 2006 when she retired from the sport.</p><p>Stacy Keibler is one of America’s most beautiful and hottest women, appearing in the international men’s magazine “Maxim” under the 100 hottest women list for 7 consecutive years. In 2006, she was listed as number 5 and the next year in 2007, she was listed as number 70.</p><p>Keibler has goen on to appear four more times on the coveted list in the positions of 89th, 77th, 72nd, and 51st between 2009 and 2012 respectively.</p><p>Stacey Keibler was listed among the 100 sexiest women list compiled by FMH as number 64 in 2008. That same year, she was named the World’s Hottest Athlete by InGameNow.</p><p>The most well-known part of her career is her duration as a wrestler. Stacy Keibler joined the world of wrestling in 1999 when she joined World Championship Wrestling as a new member of the Nitro Girls dance troupe. Once she became a member of the troupe, she performed dance routines weekly. Nicknamed “The Legs of WCW” thanks to her long legs, she became one of the most liked valets of the WCW. Throughout her career, she helped manage many wrestlers including David Flair, the Dudley Boyz, and Standards and Practices.</p><p>When WWE (then WWF) bought the company WCW, they also bought Stacy Keibler’s contract. She began to get more exposure and appearances as a diva in WWE. She became the only female wrestler to move over to WWE from WCW. In 2004, Stacy was awarded the title of WWE Diva of the Year. After spending seven years as a wrestler, Stacy quit the wrestling world in 2006. She stated that her reason for doing so was the strenuous work schedule she had. According to her, it was stressful for herself and her personal relationships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-she-doing-now></span><strong>What Is She Doing Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stacy Keibler is apparently off the market. In fact, she has been for quite some time now. In 2013, Stacey began dating Jared Pobre, the CEO of Future Ads. Before the relationship began, they were friends for a long time. In 2014, they got married in a beautiful ceremony in Mexico. They have two children; a daughter named Ava Grace Pobre and a son named Bodhi Brooks.</p><p>In 2016, she made an appearance in the documentary Ballerina I’m Not. The documentary, written and directed by Francesca Zappitelli, follows the journey of a woman who must tackle the obstacles that appear in her path through a male-dominated world as she tries to achieve her dreams. Released in March 2016, it stars Julie Ginther, Stacy Keibler, Mildred Burke, and Rick Bassman.</p><p>Keibler has largely stayed away from the spotlight making only sporadic appearances like in April 2019 when she handled the induction ceremony of Torrie Wilson into the WWE Hall of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMrKuam6liuKa1waWcq2WRo7Fuw8eaq2aho2LAqbGMnaaippdiu7DDjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-stacy-keibler-and-what-is-she-doing-now.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Stacy%20Keibler%20And%20What%20Is%20She%20Doing%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-stacy-keibler-and-what-is-she-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-stacy-keibler-and-what-is-she-doing-now.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Stacy%20Keibler%20And%20What%20Is%20She%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-stacy-keibler-and-what-is-she-doing-now.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Stacy%20Keibler%20And%20What%20Is%20She%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-stacy-keibler-and-what-is-she-doing-now.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Stacy%20Keibler%20And%20What%20Is%20She%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-stacy-keibler-and-what-is-she-doing-now.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Stacy%20Keibler%20And%20What%20Is%20She%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kathy-whitworth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eight Years Old Professional Golf Player, Kathy Whitworth Living A Single Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./busters-mal-heart-2017.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buster's Mal Heart movie review (2017)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
