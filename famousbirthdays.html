He was later inspired to study acting professionally later in life because of his family's love of the theater.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><br><h2>Education</h2><p>One of the first post-secondary schools that <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong> attended was the British American Drama Academy.
