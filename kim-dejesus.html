Iliff</strong> widely recognized as <strong>Kim DeJesus</strong> is a popular actress, reality star and model. She has starred in hit movies such as <i>Sullivan & Son, Happy Ending</i> as well as in Bollywood box office hit movie, <i>Dhoom 3</i>. However, she rose to fame after tying the knot with professional baseball outfielder, <strong>David DeJesus</strong>.</p><p>The well-known model, Kim, was born on <i>2 February 1981</i> in Wheaton, Illinois, the USA. Likewise, she was born under the birth sign, Aquarius. She belongs to white ethnicity and holds an American nationality. However, people are curious to know about this personal beauty life. So, let's take time and know about her private life.</p><h2>Kim DeJesus Is Married</h2><p>Sad to say, but the beautiful model, Kim is already married to the love of her life, David Jesus. David is a former professional baseball player who has played in Major League Baseball for great teams such as <i>Kansas City Royals</i> and <i>Tampa Bay Rays</i>. The two started dating when David was playing with the Kansas City Royals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/6/Kim-DeJesus-David-DeJesus-wags-e1484151084688%20(1)-1586177893390.jpg><p>Kim and David has been very secretive concerning their love life and details regarding their marriage. Back in 2012, she shared her experience living with her now-husband, David while he was playing for Kansas City,</p><p><i>"We would stay up until 3 a.m. watching movies, order room service, and wake up at 11 a.m.," she said. "Dave would leave for the field around 1 p.m., and I would spend the day exploring a new city and then go to his games at night."</i></p><p>The duo is living happily without unwanted rumors of their divorce and controversies over the decade.</p><h2>Blessed With A Kid</h2><p>The married couple also shares a kid from their marital relationship. Kim gave birth to a son named <strong>David Kingston DeJesus Jr.</strong> in 2010. As of now, DeJesus Jr. is ten years old. As of now, the pair is splitting their time between looking after him and their professional life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/6/20398413_1713483468960033_1800071457187823616_n%20(1)-1586177803523.jpg><p>Kim often uploads pictures with her son on her Instagram account with sweet captions. Furthermore, the loving family of three owns a dog, which is of Labrador Retriever breed.</p><h2>How Rich Is Kim DeJesus?</h2><p>Kim has earned a lucrative amount of money from her successful career as an actress, model, and reality star. Kim's net worth is <strong>$1 Million</strong> as of 2020, which is similar to <a href=#><strong>Sephora Coman</strong></a>. According to salary, the average income of an actress is <strong>$56,000</strong>. However, being an actress of films such as Dhoom 3, which earned <strong>$88,031,955</strong> worldwide, she must be earning over <strong>$90,000</strong> per year.&nbsp;</p><p>Being a model, she has an attractive body figure and beautiful looks. So, she might be earning over <strong>$80,000</strong> per year as the average income of a model in the USA is <strong>$42,180</strong> annually. Furthermore, she has also appeared in the reality show<i> Amazing Race 23</i>. Her other source of income includes photoshoots, endorsements deals, commercials, and promotional works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/6/dejesus%20(1)-1586178035729.jpg><p>On the other hand, her partner, David's net worth, is around <strong>$40 Million,</strong> which is the same as the NBA player, <a href=#><strong>Charles Barkley</strong></a>. He earned this hefty amount of dollars from his career as a professional baseball player. Currently, he works as a sports analyst and might be making a three-digit salary from it.
